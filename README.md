Hello. In this Python program using matplotlib library
And nympy, I wrote a program that displays the population of ten provinces of Iran on the map of Iran.
In the basemap program
The nympy library is not used and the for loop is used.
I use nympy in the map program and there is also a map guide 
And using nympy
The program is much more concise and useful.
Then, using scatter, we draw all the points at once.
